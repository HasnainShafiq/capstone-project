# Hameem BJJ ecommerce project
### A full-stack project using React, React-Router, and Firestore. A work-in-progress.

#### Overview
This is my take on the crwn-clothing project by Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang. I decided to make the project more personal and meaningful to me, so after gaining permission from the instructor at my local BJJ gym, I decided to make a mock BJJ ecommerce store for my local gym.

I have gained familiarity with Firebase/Firestore and React-Router, and have had a lot of practice using react hooks such as useState and useEffect. I have also gained an appreciation for the importance of state management tools in the form of react Context. This project is constantly being worked on, so I'm excited to be introduced to new concepts such as redux, react toolkit, and GraphQL. 

Currently, the project uses stock images but I have been granted permission by the instructor at the BJJ gym to use assets which are hosted on their actual website.
